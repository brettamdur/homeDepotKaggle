# homeDepotKaggle
This is the code associated with our team's submission in "Improving Home Depot Product Search Relevance", a Kaggle competition in which our team finished in the top 15%.  I was resposible for the team's feature engineering strategy and related coding. See http://blog.nycdatascience.com/students-work/improving-home-depot-search-relevance/ for a blog post relating to our team's approach, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnGE3H0AmI for a video of our team's presentation about our approach that was delivered to a gathering of data scientists at a public event hosted by the New York City Data Science Academy.
